Spotiqueue
==========

A terribly simple Cocoa app for keyboard-based queue-oriented Spotify use.

Beware of rough edges. Scratches my itch, no other guarantees granted.

Keyboard shortcuts
------------------

* Use arrows to navigate around lists (maybe using shift to select stuff).
* Tab cycles through search, search results and queue.
* Pressing ⏎ (Return) on a single item plays it immediately.
* Pressing ⏎ with multiple songs selected enqueues them and starts playing.
* `⌘E` enqueues, `⌘⇧E` adds tracks to top of queue.
* `⌘N` jumps to the next track. Also useful for starting playback.
